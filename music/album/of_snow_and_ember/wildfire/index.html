      <h1><span>Lyrics and analysis</span></h1>
		 <b>Wrapped in biting wind</b><br />
         <span><span>Everyone is encompassed by the storm that encompasses the entire planet.</span></span><br />	
		 <b>Hearts will never bleed</b><br /> 
		 <span><span>Everyone needs to stay strong.</span></span><br />
		 <b>Frozen and banished</b><br /> 
		 <b>Out of grief</b><br /> 	
		 <span><span>The underworld was put in a stasis by Cocolia through being cut off from the overworld.</span></span><br />
		 <b>In their restless dreams</b><br /> 
		 <b>They try so hard to breathe</b><br /> 	
		 <b>Pulses flutter and sting</b><br />
		 <b>Within this bleakness</b><br /> 
		 <span><span>The people of the underworld are forced to fight for their lives to continue on everyday, many dying and struggling as a result.</span></span><br />
		 <b>Pain will come with the blade</b><br /> 	
		 <b>Pain will wake up the despondent crowd</b><br /> 
		 <span><span>A fight is what the world and the people of it need to make a change and remove the pain of the underworld.</span></span><br />
		 <b>In this dormant world somehow</b><br /> 	
		 <b>Unsheathe a sword not to kill</b><br />
		 <b>Unsheathe a sword to rend those clouds above the ground</b><br />
		 <span><span>The fight is against the Stelleron holding back the planet, not the people of the overworld.</span></span><br />
		 <b>Wake up, it's time to gather now</b><br />
		 <span><span>The planet can be taken back from the Stelleron by both worlds putting aside their differences and working together.</span></span><br />
		 <b>The only warmth remains</b><br />
		 <b>In hands clasped so tight</b><br />
		 <span><span>The cold caused by the Stelleron has removed warmth and hope for most.</span></span><br />
		 <b>The only fire exists</b><br />
		 <b>In brave hearts</b><br />
		 <span><span>The ones keeping all alive are those who choose to fight.</span></span><br />
		 <b>Seasons that refuse</b><br />
		 <b>To change over the years</b><br />
		 <span><span>The etternal winter caused by the Stelleron.</span></span><br />
		 <b>Will find their way back</b><br />
		 <b>Back on track</b><br />
		 <span><span>The planet will return to how it is meant to be.</span></span><br />
		 <b>We've made a choice, go fight against your fate!</b><br />
		 <span><span>The people will fight against the plan put forward by Cocolia following the Stelleron.</span></span></br >
		 <b>Pain will come with the blade</b><br />
		 <b>Pain will wake up the despondent crowd</b><br />
		 <span><span>A fight is what the world and the people of it need to make a change and remove the pain of the underworld.</span></span><br />

		 <b>Unsheathe a sword to rend those clouds above the ground</b><br />
		 <b>Wake up, it's time to gather now</b><br />
		 <span><span>The planet can be taken back from the Stelleron by both worlds putting aside their differences and working together.</span></span><br />
		 <b>Forget about the rules</b><br />
		 <b>Written on weathered rock</b><br />
		 <span><span></span></span><br />
		 <b>There were chasers of light</b><br />
		 <span><span></span></span><br />
		 <b>Find the way or get lost</b><br />
		 <span><span></span></span><br />
		 <b>We have no way to know</b><br />
		 <b>Where they all headed for</b><br />
		 <span><span></span></span><br />
		 <b>See the light from afar</b><br />
		 <span><span></span></span><br />
		 <b>Just blaze through the thorns</b><br />
		 <span><span></span></span><br />
		 <b>We know it's right over there</b><br />
		 <span><span>The future is within reach.</span></span><br />
		 <b>We have something to declare</b><br />
		 <b>Whatever is arriving, we'll be prepared</b><br />
		 <span><span>The future is uncertain but the people of Belobog will be able to handle what ever comes their way together.</span></span><br >
		 <b>We've made a choice, go fight against your fate!</b><br />
		 <span><span>The people will fight against the plan put forward by Cocolia following the Stelleron.</span></span></br >
		 <b>Pain will come with the blade</b><br />

		 <b>Unsheathe a sword to rend those clouds above the ground</b><br />
		 <span><span>The fight is against the Stelleron holding back the planet, not the people of the overworld.</span></span><br />
		 <b>Wake up to hear the cheering sound</b><br /> 
		 <span><span>The battle has been won. The Stelleron and the negative policies are now gone.</span></span><br />
